# Factors Affecting Food Hygiene - Report

## Background

The Food Hygiene Rating scheme operates in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Many types of businesses must be inspected and given a score, ranging from restaurants to manufacturers to schools. The scheme was established in 2010, and inspections have occurred regularly since. And establishments are located in both more affluent and more deprived areas. Furthermore, people of various races and ethnicities own establishments, promoting various foreign cuisines we cherish on a regular basis.

Due to these differences, a thorough analysis of factors and their links with food hygiene standards has been performed, with the following factors investigated to discover any insights in food hygiene variations:

- Country (England/Wales/Northern  Ireland)
- Business Type (Restaurants, Takeaways, Schools etc.)
- Inspection Date (2010 - present, January - December)
- Deprivation (Affluent/Average/Deprived)
- Race (White/Black/Asian) [note - this goes by London boroughs with large populations of certain races, since the race of business owners cannot be determined/assumed]

Each factor will now be discussed and key findings will be stated.

## Key Findings

- Business in Northern Ireland have significantly higher average Food Hygiene Ratings compared to in England and Wales.

## Detailed Analysis

### Country

The mean Food Hygiene Rating has been calculated for the 3 countries: England, Wales and Northern Ireland. These values are, to two decimal places:

England: 4.63

Wales: 4.58

Northern Ireland: 4.77

Clearly, Northern Ireland has by far the highest average Food Hygiene Rating, 0.14 points greater than England and 0.19 points greater than Wales, with the lowest average rating. 

The mean Hygiene scores for the 3 countries are, to two decimal places:

England: 3.05

Wales: 2.94

Northern Ireland: 2.24

Again, Northern Ireland performs by far the best in terms of Hygiene, in line with the general Rating trend. The Hygiene standards in Wales are slightly higher than in England, possibly indicating that businesses in Wales take hygienic food handling slightly more seriously than in England, although overall the difference is negligible. Despite all this, Hygiene standards are still very good on average for all 3 countries.

The mean Cleanliness scores for the 3 countries are, to two decimal places:

England: 3.81

Wales: 3.97

Northern Ireland: 3.73

Yet again, Northern Ireland yields the best average cleanliness, but the difference is quite small between all 3 countries. Still, this suggests that on average, businesses in NI are very slightly cleaner than businesses in Wales, with England in the middle. Nonetheless, good standards are universal.

The mean Management scores for the 3 countries are, to two decimal places:

England: 3.99

Wales: 3.89

Northern Ireland: 3.38

Unsurprisingly, Northern Ireland has the best average Management of food safety, continue to support the general trend. England and Wales have similar, slightly lower standards, but still good standards nonetheless.

To support the insights further, rating counts have also been computed and the results are as follows:

England
- 0: 765 (0.18%)
- 1: 5849 (1.38%)
- 2: 6208 (1.47%)
- 3: 25345 (5.99%)
- 4: 60773 (14.37%)
- 5: 323855 (76.6%)

Rating Counts for Wales
- 0: 42 (0.14%)
- 1: 498 (1.66%)
- 2: 407 (1.36%)
- 3: 1991 (6.65%)
- 4: 5159 (17.24%)
- 5: 21835 (72.95%)

Rating Counts for Northern Ireland
- 0: 1 (0.01%)
- 1: 75 (0.49%)
- 2: 109 (0.71%)
- 3: 528 (3.46%)
- 4: 1857 (12.16%)
- 5: 12704 (83.17%)

These statistics continue to demonstrate the higher Food Hygiene Rating scores in Northern Ireland. A score of 3 or above is considered a pass. Hence, the pass rates are as follows:

England: 96.96%

Wales: 96.84%

Northern Ireland: 98.79%

Northern Ireland has by far the highest pass rate, and businesses in England/Wales are over 3 times more likely to fail than businesses in Northern Ireland.

Furthermore, only 1 zero rating has been recorded in Northern Ireland, compared to 42 in Wales and 765 in England.

One unlikely cause could be that for whatever reason, the inspectors in Northern Ireland are the most lenient, resulting in higher ratings. This however would be very unfair, so this is not a reasonable explanation.

Higher ratings in Northern Ireland are more realisically linked to mandatory display. Since 7th October 2016, food safety law enforces that all establishments in Northern Ireland are legally obliged to display their Food Hygiene Rating sticker in a prominent place, such as the entrance. This serves as a major motivator for high food hygiene standards, since a low rating would need to be displayed, deterring many potential customers and thus, causing a very negative effect on profit for such businesses. The higher the rating, the more confidence consumers have in the safety of a particular establishment, so this makes mandatory display a reasonable explanation for the higher ratings in NI.

However, there is an inconsistency with this explanation, since Wales also has mandatory display, starting even earlier than Northern Ireland, in 2013. This leaves England as the only country without mandatory display, only encouraged display, so one would think that Wales also has higher food hygiene ratings than England. Instead, Wales has a lower average rating than England, contradicting the higher ratings in NI. There must be another underlying reason leading to the lower ratings in Wales, which cannot easily be determined.
