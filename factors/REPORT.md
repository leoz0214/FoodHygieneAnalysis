# Factors Affecting Food Hygiene - Report

## Background

The Food Hygiene Rating scheme operates in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Many types of businesses must be inspected and given a score, ranging from restaurants to manufacturers to schools. The scheme was established in 2010, and inspections have occurred regularly since. And establishments are located in both more affluent and more deprived areas. Furthermore, people of various races and ethnicities own establishments, promoting various foreign cuisines we cherish on a regular basis.

Due to these differences, a thorough analysis of factors and their links with food hygiene standards has been performed, with the following factors investigated to discover any insights in food hygiene variations:

- **Country** (England/Wales/Northern Ireland)
- **Business Type** (Restaurants, Takeaways, Schools etc.)
- **Inspection Date** (2010 - present, January - December)
- **Deprivation** (Affluent/Average/Deprived)
- **Race** (White/Black/Asian) [note - this goes by London boroughs with large populations of certain races, since the race of business owners cannot be determined/assumed]

Each factor will now be discussed and key findings will be stated.

## Key Findings

- Businesses in **Northern Ireland** have significantly higher average Food Hygiene Ratings compared to England and Wales.
- Schools/Universities, Farmers and Hospitals/Childcare have the highest average Food Hygiene Ratings.
- Takeaways have the lowest average Food Hygiene Ratings by far.

## Detailed Analysis

### Country

The mean Food Hygiene Rating has been calculated for the 3 countries: England, Wales and Northern Ireland. These values are, to two decimal places:

England: 4.63

Wales: 4.58

**Northern Ireland: 4.77**

Clearly, Northern Ireland has by far the highest average Food Hygiene Rating, 0.14 points greater than England and 0.19 points greater than Wales, with the lowest average rating. 

The mean Hygiene scores for the 3 countries are, to two decimal places:

England: 3.05

Wales: 2.94

**Northern Ireland: 2.24**

Again, Northern Ireland performs by far the best in terms of Hygiene, in line with the general Rating trend. The Hygiene standards in Wales are slightly higher than in England, possibly indicating that businesses in Wales take hygienic food handling slightly more seriously than in England, although overall the difference is negligible. Despite all this, Hygiene standards are still very good on average for all 3 countries.

The mean Cleanliness scores for the 3 countries are, to two decimal places:

England: 3.81

Wales: 3.97

Northern Ireland: 3.73

Yet again, Northern Ireland yields the best average cleanliness, but the difference is quite small between all 3 countries. Still, this suggests that on average, businesses in NI are very slightly cleaner than businesses in Wales, with England in the middle. Nonetheless, good standards are universal.

The mean Management scores for the 3 countries are, to two decimal places:

England: 3.99

Wales: 3.89

**Northern Ireland: 3.38**

Unsurprisingly, Northern Ireland has the best average Management of food safety, continuing to support the general trend. England and Wales have similar, slightly lower standards, but still good standards nonetheless.

To support the insights further, rating counts have also been computed and the results are as follows:

England
- 0: 765 (0.18%)
- 1: 5849 (1.38%)
- 2: 6208 (1.47%)
- 3: 25345 (5.99%)
- 4: 60773 (14.37%)
- 5: 323855 (76.6%)

Rating Counts for Wales
- 0: 42 (0.14%)
- 1: 498 (1.66%)
- 2: 407 (1.36%)
- 3: 1991 (6.65%)
- 4: 5159 (17.24%)
- 5: 21835 (72.95%)

Rating Counts for Northern Ireland
- **0: 1 (0.01%)**
- 1: 75 (0.49%)
- 2: 109 (0.71%)
- 3: 528 (3.46%)
- 4: 1857 (12.16%)
- 5: 12704 (83.17%)

These statistics continue to demonstrate the higher Food Hygiene Rating scores in Northern Ireland. A score of 3 or above is considered a pass. Hence, the pass rates are as follows:

England: 96.96%

Wales: 96.84%

**Northern Ireland: 98.79%**

Northern Ireland has by far the highest pass rate, and businesses in England/Wales are over twice as likely to fail than businesses in Northern Ireland.

Furthermore, only 1 zero rating has been recorded in Northern Ireland, compared to 42 in Wales and 765 in England.

One unlikely cause could be that for whatever reason, the inspectors in Northern Ireland are the most lenient, resulting in higher ratings. This however would be very unfair, so this is not a reasonable explanation.

Higher ratings in Northern Ireland are more realisically linked to **mandatory display**. Since 7th October 2016, food safety law enforces that all establishments in Northern Ireland are **legally obliged to display their Food Hygiene Rating sticker in a prominent place**, such as the entrance. This serves as a major motivator for high food hygiene standards, since a low rating would need to be displayed, deterring many potential customers and thus, causing a very negative effect on profit for such businesses. The higher the rating, the more confidence consumers have in the safety of a particular establishment, so this makes mandatory display a reasonable explanation for the higher ratings in NI.

However, there is an **inconsistency** with this explanation, since Wales also has mandatory display, starting even earlier than Northern Ireland, in 2013. This leaves England as the only country without mandatory display (only encouraged display), so one would think that Wales also has higher food hygiene ratings than England. Instead, Wales has a lower average rating than England, contradicting the higher ratings in NI. There must be another underlying reason leading to the lower ratings in Wales, which cannot easily be determined. And equally likely are other reasons for the higher ratings in NI.

## Business Type

It is reasonable to expect Food Hygiene Ratings to vary by business type, because certain establishments need to be much stricter in terms of food safety due to the type of consumers, especially when considering consumers that may be immunocompromised or at high risk of food poisoning. Certain business types may also have stricter food safety rules depending on the level of risk to consumers.

The business types considered are as follows:
- Restaurants/Cafes/Canteens
- Takeaways
- Pubs/Bars
- Retailers
- Schools/Universities
- Hospitals/Childcare
- Hotels
- Mobile Caterers
- Manufacturers
- Farmers
- Distributors/Transporters
- Importers/Exporters

And so, here are the average Food Hygiene Ratings for each business type, to two decimal places, from highest to lowest:

1. Schools/Universities: 4.89
2. Farmers: 4.85
3. Hospitals/Childcare: 4.83
4. Mobile Caterers: 4.80
5. Hotels: 4.77
6. Manufacturers: 4.73
7. Distributors/Transporters: 4.73
8. Importers/Exporters: 4.71
9. Pubs/Bars: 4.63
10. Restaurants/Cafes/Canteens: 4.58
11. Retailers: 4.54
12. Takeaways: 4.28

The graph is an alternative illustration of the data.
<img src="report_images/rating_by_business_type.png">

This shows that Schools/Universities have the highest average Food Hygiene Rating by quite a lot, 0.04 points greater than the next highest, Farmers. On the other hand, Takeways have the lowest average Food Hygiene Rating by far, a whopping 0.26 points lower on average than the next lowest, Retailers. Nonetheless, there is generally a very good standard of hygiene throughout all business types, except Takeaways of course, where there is a significant lower standard, but not alarmingly low.

Next, here are the average Hygiene scores by business type, rounded to two decimal places, from best to worst:

1. Farmers: 1.66
2. Importers/Exporters: 1.72
3. Schools/Universities: 1.90
4. Distributors/Transporters: 1.93
5. Manufacturers: 2.19
6. Mobile Caterers: 2.34
7. Hospitals/Childcare: 2.44
8. Hotels: 2.70
9. Retailers: 2.92
10. Pubs/Bars: 3.10
11. Restaurants/Cafes/Canteens: 3.54
12. Takeaways: 4.69

The graph illustrates this data.
<img src="report_images/hygiene_by_business_type.png">

Hygiene standards vary a lot by business type. Farmers do the best in terms of Hygiene, followed by various other supplier-based businesses. Other than suppliers, Schools/Universities do well too, ranking third. Again, following the Rating trend, Takeaways have significantly worse average Hygiene scores, 1.15 points greater than the next worst, Restaurants/Cafes/Canteens.

Next, here are the average Cleanliness scores by business type, rounded to two decimal places, from best to worst:

1. Farmers: 2.38
2. Importers/Exporters: 2.43
3. Mobile Caterers: 2.62
4. Distributors/Transporters: 2.93
5. Hospitals/Childcare: 2.96
6. Schools/Universities: 3.06
7. Hotels: 3.25
8. Manufacturers: 3.33
9. Retailers: 3.93
10. Restaurants/Cafes/Canteens: 4.34
11. Pubs/Bars: 4.52
12. Takeaways: 5.47

The graph illustrates this data.
<img src="report_images/cleanliness_by_business_type.png">

Cleanliness standards certainly vary across different business types. Farmers have the highest cleanliness standards, followed closely by Importers/Exporters. Mobile Caterers do well in terms of cleanliness too. Unfortunately, Takeaways again appear to be the least clean on average by far, 0.95 points greater than the next worst, Pubs/Bars.

Finally, the average Management scores by business type are as follows, to two decimal places:

1. Schools/Universities: 2.37
2. Farmers: 2.67
3. Importers/Exporters: 3.11
4. Hospitals/Childcare: 3.22
5. Distributors/Transporters: 3.22
6. Mobile Caterers: 3.35
7. Hotels: 3.52
8. Manufacturers: 3.55
9. Pubs/Bars: 3.83
10. Retailers: 4.19
11. Restaurants/Cafes/Canteens: 4.31
12. Takeaways: 5.65

The graph illustrates this data.
<img src="report_images/management_by_business_type.png">

There is a huge disparity in Management standards across different business types. On one hand, Schools/Universities have by far the highest Management standard 0.30 points less than the next best, Farmers. Conversely, Takeaways score 5.65 points in Management on average, a whopping 1.24 points greater than the second lowest, Restaurants/Cafes/Canteens.

Based on these statistics, the business types that stand out most are as follows:

- Schools/Universities
- Hospitals/Childcare
- Farmers
- Takeaways

School/Universities, as already seen, have the highest average Food Hygiene Ratings, scoring very well on average in terms of Hygiene, Cleanliness and Management. This is because the health and safety of children and staff is taken extremely seriously, particularly since children have less developed immune systems and are more prone to allergies. Food contamination may lead to food poisoning or allergic reactions, which may be life-threatening, and will result in lost education for students or teaching time for teachers, something which has negative future consequences. Hence, very good Hygiene scores are attained. Cleanliness standards are naturally very high in school kitchens. Since allergy prevention is one the most important causes in schools, school canteen staff are extremely well trained in food safety practices ensuring unsafe food is avoided by those with allergies, hence resulting in very good Management scores.

Likewise, Hospitals/Childcare also yield very high food safety standards, and this is completely as one would expect. In hospitals, many patients have weakened immune systems and/or are older, and the nature of hospitals means they are major sources of infection due to sick patients. Safe, nutritous food is a cruical step in the recovery process for patients, whereas contaminated food has a much higher chance of leading to food poisoning in hospitals than usual, due to the high rate of immunocompromisation, and food poisoning also has a much higher chance of causing life-threatening complications in sick patients than in healthy individuals. Therefore, Hygiene is vitally important in hospitals. Hospitals are also naturally kept extremely clean, and so are their kitchens, as part of the safe environment. And so, Management of food safety is paramount, as part of patient protection. Childcare settings also follow the same idea, where young children have underdeveloped immune systems so need to be protected extra carefully from food poisoning or the complications could be very serious.

Slightly differently, Farmers score very well in terms of food hygiene, not because they directly involve high-risk consumers, but probably because there are less food safety procedures to follow. As farms, by nature, involve live animals and are generally outdoors, a high level of Hygiene and Cleanliness cannot be achieved like in a typical kitchen, so some degree of leniency is to be expected. Decent Management is expected, but due to the relatively basic food safety requirements for Farmers, it is somewhat easier for Farmers to score highly compared to other business types that provide food directly to consumers.

On the other hand, Takeaways clearly score most poorly in all aspects of the Food Hygiene Rating scheme, suggesting worse food safety standards on average compared to other establishments. This is likely because most takeaways are small, often family-run businesses, where the budget is tight and there is only a small number of often less qualified staff. Hence, commercial Hygiene and Cleanliness standards may not be reached or maintainable for many takeaways due to the limited manpower and funds. Certain structural repairs or safety installations may be unaffordable, impeding food safety. Likewise, due to the limited staff, Management of food safety can be difficult to maintain and unfortunately, lots of takeaways fail in this aspect. In rare cases, but more often than in other business types, takeaway staff are simply unaware about proper commercial food safety measures and manage the takeaway kitchen like at home, where food safety can be ignored slightly more, despite the fact that a commercial kitchen needs to comply with food safety laws for public health and safety. The worst cases are staff that completely neglect food safety, again most common in takeaways. Furthermore, a shocking number of takeaways are simply for money laundering purposes, where food safety is virtually ignored. The many combined reasons provide a general idea regarding why takeaways have lower average food safety standards.
